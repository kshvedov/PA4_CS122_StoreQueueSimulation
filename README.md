# PA4_CS122_StoreQueueSimulation
Project 4 From CS 122 Store Queues implemented with queue's in C

This project was developed primarily for the learning of queues and how they work
through a life like example implementation. All queues within the project
were implemented by hand not using any libraries.

The project simulates two queues within a grocery store, an express queue and a
normal one. Both are simulated with the Queue (FIFO) for a certain amount of
minutes with random people entering them with a random amount of groceries.
Each new person that enters is printed, and each that leaves is also printed.
Every 10 minutes (in simulation) both lanes are printed.
